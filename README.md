# Bulletproof Testing in Python

This repo contains a guide to mocking in Python, and three exercises to help you learn how to use mocks.

## How to use this guide
We expect familiarity with Python, and some experience with unit testing. You should have Python 3 and pip installed on your system.

While this guide is geared towards bash environments (Mac, Linux), you should be able to follow along on Windows.
